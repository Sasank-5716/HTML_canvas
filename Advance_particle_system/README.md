# Particle Physics Canvas Demo
A visually engaging interactive particle system built with JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas. Particles bounce around the screen, respond to gravity, friction, and elasticity, and interact with the mouse. Includes controls to toggle gravity and reset the system.

## Features
Animated Particles: 150 colorful particles with glowing effects.

Physics Simulation: Realistic gravity, friction, and elastic collisions with canvas boundaries.

Mouse Interaction: Click and drag to attract or repel nearby particles.

Responsive Design: Canvas resizes dynamically with the window.

Controls:

Toggle Gravity: Enable or disable gravity.

Reset: Reinitialize all particles.

## Getting Started
1. Clone or Download
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sasank-5716/HTML_canvas
```
```bash
cd Advance_particle_system
```

## How It Works
Particles: Each particle has a random position, velocity, color, and radius.

Physics: Gravity pulls particles down; friction slows them over time; elasticity makes them bounce off canvas edges.

Mouse: Hold and drag on the canvas to push/pull particles within a certain radius.

Controls:

Toggle Gravity: Click to turn gravity on/off.

Reset: Click to regenerate all particles with new random properties.

## Customization
Colors: Particles use random HSL colors for a vibrant effect.

Glow: Each particle has a radial gradient for a glowing appearance.

Performance: You can reduce PARTICLE_COUNT for better performance on slower devices.

## Browser Compatibility
Modern browsers supporting HTML5 Canvas and ES6 JavaScript.

## Acknowledgments
Inspired by classic particle and physics simulations in JavaScript.
